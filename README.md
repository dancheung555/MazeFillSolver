# MazeFillSolver
Creating algorithms to solve **maze fills**. 
A maze fill is where you have to connect all the points in a 2d array with a few missing points.
Prerequisites for this solver:
1. You are given one 2d array (m x n)
2. There is only one distinct entrance and exit
3. There is at least one path that will fill the entire 2d array.

Let's get algorithming!
